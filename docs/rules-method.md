# Our method, version 2: verified card → rule-based indicators → aggregation

Design decided in the working notes on 2026-10-19 (sections 2.1–2.4); specifications in `docs/spec/`
into `docs/spec/` (card format, worked examples, aggregation). The LLM tournament over the whole pool (ladder
step L4) is kept as an intermediate step for comparison; the two Co-Scientist baselines (L0, L0ts) keep their
tournaments. The 2026 baseline's plagiarism penalty and claim-versus-log checks are not reproduced: both act on
generated ideas and manuscripts, and external hypotheses have no experiment logs (decision 2026-10-19).

| Step | Who | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Normalizer: text → declared card (claims in a closed vocabulary, each with a verbatim `source_span`) | LLM, contract in spec section 9 | next |
| Validation and admission (accepted / needs refinement / not a hypothesis) | code: `hyparena/card/rules.py` | done |
| Verifier: evidence records with verbatim quotes, quote role, context match, endpoint | LLM extracts, code checks quotes | next |
| Claim statuses, gate, evidence profile, next step, known result | code: `hyparena/card/rules.py` | done |
| Indicators (spec 8a) | code: `hyparena/card/indicators.py` | done for evidence-based ones; cost, time, late start and informativeness stay unknown until their inputs exist |
| Aggregation under preference profiles (МРСП / SMAA-2) | code: `hyparena/aspid.py`, profiles in `configs/profiles.yaml` | done |
| Ranking across profiles, robust candidates | code: `hyparena/card/rank.py` | done |
| Debates on the top (prosecution vs defence; competitor pairs) | LLM | later |
| Card-based proximity, alternatives and prediction table, evolution loop | code + LLM | later |

**Aggregation as implemented** (Aggregation_Spec):
- additive value over indicators in [0, 1];
- cardinal indicators on fixed reference scales (no min–max over the pool);
- ordinal indicators with the SMAA-O random monotone mapping;
- unknown values drawn uniformly in every iteration;
- weights uniform over the profile's admissible set: exact for no constraints and for complete tiers, hit-and-run (parallel chains) for partial orders and equal groups;
- outputs from one pass with common random numbers: expected value, spread, quantiles, pairwise winning indices (ties count half), rank acceptabilities, P(top-k), P(best), central weights, confidence factors (central weights fixed, data varied), Monte Carlo half-width. Exact ties in a draw share places at random.

**Tests** (`python -m pytest tests/`):
- the worked examples as fixtures (`tests/fixtures/cards`): statuses, gate, profile, next step, admission, known result, the endpoint trap;
- the checks of Aggregation_Spec section 7: uniform simplex, centroid weights by both samplers, dominance, symmetry, unknowns widen the spread, Monte Carlo error, independence from the pool;
- an end-to-end ranking of the examples.

**Profiles** (`configs/profiles.yaml`, all drafts until set with experts): `evidence_first` (verified evidence first), `cheap_feasible` and `fundamental` (the examples in the notes).
